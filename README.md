üéì Edu-Viz: AI-Powered Educational Videos

‚ú® Project Overview

Edu-Viz is a groundbreaking project that transforms static textbook knowledge into dynamic, AI-powered animated videos. By bridging the gap between dense theory and engaging visuals, our platform offers a personalized learning experience for complex subjects like Data Structures, GIS, and Space Tech. Instead of reading, students can simply query a concept and watch it come to life.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Our system is an orchestrated pipeline of powerful, modern technologies. The process flows from a user query to a final video, managed by a robust backend.

    User Query: A student enters a concept (e.g., "Graph Traversal").

    Knowledge Retrieval: Our system queries a Knowledge Graph (built on Neo4j) to fetch structured information, concepts, and relationships.

    Content Generation: An AI Layer (using models like Gemini or GPT) takes the retrieved data and generates a detailed narration script and a bullet-point outline for a series of slides.

    Content Formatting: The raw AI output is standardized into a structured format (JSON), ensuring consistency and machine-readability.

    Video Animation: A Manim Automation Layer parses the formatted content and programmatically generates the animations and visuals for each slide, perfectly synchronized with the narration script.

    Video Output: The final MP4 video is rendered and stored for future retrieval, ready to be shared and watched.

üöÄ Key Features

    Personalized Learning: Get explanations tailored to specific queries, moving beyond one-size-fits-all textbooks.

    Engaging Visuals: Utilize high-quality, auto-generated animations to simplify complex topics.

    Scalable & Efficient: The automated pipeline allows for the rapid creation of educational content for diverse domains.

    Structured Knowledge: Our Knowledge Graph foundation ensures accuracy and provides a clear, interconnected view of subjects.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

    Backend: FastAPI

    Knowledge Graph: Neo4j / RDF Store

    AI: Gemini / GPT API

    Video Generation: Manim Community Edition

    Database: PostgreSQL / Redis (for caching)

üöß Trade-offs & Design Decisions

    Why a Knowledge Graph? We chose a graph database over traditional SQL for its ability to model complex, interconnected relationships between concepts, which is crucial for semantic search and content generation.

    Why AI API? Opting for powerful LLM APIs allows us to leverage state-of-the-art models for content creation without building custom NLP models from scratch, enabling a faster development cycle.

    Why Manim? Manim was selected for its programmatic approach to animation, which is essential for automating the video generation process at scale, unlike manual tools like PowerPoint.
