# AI-Powered Knowledge Graph → Manim Animation Automation

## Problem
Students struggle with heavy textbooks and lack engaging explanations.  
Manual creation of slides + animations is time-consuming.

## Solution
This project automates the pipeline:
1. Knowledge Graph organizes textbook concepts.
2. AI generates slides and script.
3. Formatter structures the content.
4. Manim renders an animated video.

- `pseudo_code.md` → Pipeline pseudocode
- `manim_scenes/quick_scene.py` → Sample Manim animation
- `kg/sample_kg.json` → Example KG data
